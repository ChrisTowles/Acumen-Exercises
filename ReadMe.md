# Acumen Exercises

Hey! This is a collection of small coding exercises we use during interviews. Nothing too crazy here - just some simple problems to work through together.

The goal isn't to "pass a test" or write perfect code. We want to see how you think, how you approach problems, and how you work through things when pairing. Talk through your thought process, ask questions, google stuff if you need to - that's all part of it.

We'll pick an exercise relevant to the role or interests.
